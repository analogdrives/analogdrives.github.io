**Part I: The Hunt**


Let me give you a piece of advice: do not buy a questionably legal, 15-year-old track car that you intend to daily drive. It may seem like a good idea, that you’ll make it work, and that it will be fun. It’s not, you won’t and it isn’t.


My story starts in the summer of 2014. I was an auto-obsessed 23 year-old living in not so car friendly Boston. I was ready to leave Boston and began applying for various jobs in Seattle and Los Angeles. My older brother – and little devil in my ear – was living in LA and convinced me to make the move. I appreciated his desire to get me to LA, but should have used common sense to ignore his next proposition.


Before I had a place to live I was scouring forums, Craigslist, and Autotrader for cars. What the hell was I going buy? Porsche 996? BMW 2002? Buick Grand National?! A couple weeks before I was scheduled to move I got a text from my brother: “Let’s buy a track car. You can daily it, and we’ll split everything.” In theory this made sense, my commute was ~4 miles, I wanted to go to the track as much possible, and I wanted to buy a fun car I could take to the canyons. In reality this was a hugely irresponsible decision.


I grew up in the suburbs of Seattle. My dad and brother are also total car-nuts. Not in the “let’s go restore an old Saab in the garage” way, but in the “let’s go to the Porsche dealership and subscribe to every car magazine imaginable” way. What’s my point? Well, I’m not the MOST mechanically inclined. I can change a tire, swap rotors and pads, put in a headlight, change fluids, etc. But ask me to tune a carburetor and I’ll point you to the nearest mechanic. I regret not taking shop classes growing up, or working for a mechanic in high school. One day when I have the time and money I’ll build a project car. That story will probably start the same way this one does. But I’m a moron and morons make the same mistake over and over.


I was a naïve 23-year-old and agreed to the track car idea. Now it was a matter figuring out what to buy. As always, Miata seemed to be the answer. Cheap, reliable, fast and fun. The only problem was that my brother did not fit, and was not going to fit without substantial fabrication of the driver’s seat and rails. In attempt to avoid this, we moved on from Miata’s. I then stumbled upon a fully built E30 with an S52. The car was beautiful. Brand new paint, a low mileage motor, and zero track time. The owner had built it, but decided to sell it in favor of his 1000 hp GT-R. Can’t blame him for that… I drove it around Van Nuys and was blown away. It was screaming fast, but more importantly, incredibly balanced. Before pulling the trigger I took a step back and decided to pass. As clean as the car was – it had no interior at all, a full cage, no A/C, no stereo, and no passenger seat. I’m not THAT dumb.


Ten days before I made my move to LA we stumbled upon the winning car. An Alpine white 1999 BMW M3. The owner had purchased the car with the intention of building an NASA race-car. Poly bushings everywhere, a cage, and about $3,000 worth of suspension work. The owner had simply lost interest in the project. The car had racing seats with 6-point harnesses, but maintained A/C, a stereo, and most of an interior. For $11,000, it was on the high end of the market for an E36, but I figured I’d spend a lot more getting it to that point. Note to self: never spend more on a car because it has mods. Day 1 stuff here, but when you let your emotions get the best of you buying a car, you’re screwed. I was done for.


The same weekend I moved to LA, my brother picked up and drove our new M3 to LA from San Francisco. The next day I met up with friends and spent all morning in the Malibu Canyons. The car was great. Everything about the car was great. Or so my tiny peanut brain thought. It took all of one commute to ask myself: “What the hell have I done.”


**Part II: So Far, So Good**


My M3 was not yet registered as I pulled out of the short term housing I was living in and headed down the street to work. I severely underestimated how stiff the combination of race springs, a cage, and poly bushings would be. The stiff ride didn’t bother me driving up the 1 to Malibu, or ripping around canyons at speed on nice roads with no traffic. Sitting in stop and go traffic during rush hour was another story. It felt like I was driving around the Flintstones mobile. Oh well. I knew I could power through. Hell, the car was fun to drive and fast – I didn’t need a comfortable commute – and driving a terrible daily driver is a rite of passage for car-guys (idiots).


The first track day experience in the M3 was about a month into my ownership. I hauled my brother, a set of Hankook R-S3 tires mounted to Kosei K1s and a box of tools to Buttonwillow for a Speed Ventures HPDE event. The day went off without a hitch. We did a combined 10 sessions on track with the car without issue. On my last session I overcorrected coming out of the Bus Stop and spun. Turns out spinning on R-compounds = flat spotting tires. The right rear tire was done for. Fortunately, it was the end of the day, and we simply packed up, mounted the street tires, and called it a day. The car couldn’t have run better.


As a track car the M3 was everything I could have imagined and more. The car was so predictable – perfect for someone who was learning. Fast enough to have fun, but slow enough that I wasn’t afraid of driving at close to 10/10ths. As a road car, it sucked. It was loud, harsh, low, and attracted all the wrong sorts of attention. Just a few weeks into ownership I took my girlfriend to dinner for her birthday. After putting on a nice dress for dinner, we got in the car and she buckled the 6-point harness between her legs. “Eric” she said, “it’s time for a new car. This is insane.” At the time I laughed it off. With 20/20 hindsight I would have tried to sell the car right then and there. It would have saved me a lot of money. But like I’ve mentioned, I have a peanut brain, so the M3 experiment continued.




**Part III: Things That Go Boom Part 1**


It wasn’t long before our first major mishap. Halfway through an HPDE at Streets of Willow, the car began sputtering and dying. It would start, but wouldn’t idle, and was way down on power. Because I’m not mechanically inclined, AAA was called, and the car was towed to the mechanic. That night I had also made plans with my girlfriends. Instead of being home by 6, I was riding bitch in a tow truck hoping the car was only a little bit broken. Neither one of us was thrilled.


I had no clue what to expect, but the news was not good. An over-rev lead to a bent valve: a top end rebuild was in order. Many thousands of dollars of labor later the top end rebuild was complete. We also replaced the power steering pump, shifter bushings, and made a few other minor fixes. I was certainly frustrated, but blamed myself for the over-rev. Had I known the car was cursed, I wouldn’t have bothered with the rebuild.


During the rebuild I was hitching rides to work with my brother, friends and Uber. The car was out of commission for about three weeks, during which time I had plenty of time to question my own sanity. Did it make any sense to daily drive this M3? No. Should I wait to have a track car until I have a spare garage and more disposable income? Yes. Should I sell the M3 and cut my losses? Nope.


Instead I had an even better idea. Time for the M3 to have a stablemate. I didn’t have much cash, nor did I have a garage. I wanted something that we could use to tow, I could take up to Mammoth in the winter, and most importantly, wouldn’t cost an arm and a leg to own. 1995 Buick Roadmaster Estate it was. I got the car inspected, and four days later was in Fresno picking up the most American car I’ll ever own. For $5,000 I was the proud owner of an extremely clean Roadmaster Estate with 120k original miles, a 5.7-liter LT-1, a 5,000-pound towing capacity, and room for 8. It was everything the M3 was not.


Things were looking up. I had a couch on wheels to get me to and from work, my girlfriend no longer had to strap a harness every time we went anywhere, and the famously treacherous LA roads were no longer an obstacle course.


**Part IV: Things That Go Boom Part 2**


If there was a single aha moment for me as it relates to racing cars, it happened at an a HPDE event at Spring Mountain Motorsports Ranch in Parumph, NV. The private track opened its doors for the event. I would be hard pressed to find any redeemable qualities in the town most famously known for legalizing prostitution. The track however, was something special. Brand new asphalt, long high speed sweepers, decreasing radius turns, and long straights. The track had everything, and most importantly, the place was dead. No traffic jams and no S2000 drivers who refused to let slower cars pass. We had two perfect days of driving that weekend. Sunday afternoon we loaded the M3 onto to rented U-Haul trailer, and towed the 300 miles’ home without incident. If there was a high point during M3 ownership, this was it. Unfortunately, my ownership low point was just weeks away.


After Spring Mountain, I was blessed with about a month and half of pain free driving before the car gods took a steaming dump all over me. My brother and I attended a track event at Streets of Willow. It was a hot day, but nothing out of the ordinary for the desert. In my brothers third session of the day he entered the pits early because he heard a loud slapping noise coming from under the hood. We popped the hood and noticed that one of the fan blades was partially torn. We ripped off the damaged blade, but the uneven fan would whip the shroud as it spun.  We called our mechanic, and he suggested cutting off all of the fan blades one by one. As long as weren’t sitting in traffic on the 405 in 100-degree heat, the car wouldn’t overheat. All was well. We thought. We performed plastic surgery on the fan, filled up the coolant tank, loaded up the car, and headed back towards to LA. My brother was driving the M3, and I was following in the Buick. It was but 30 miles before a giant cloud of black smoke consumed the road in front of me. Disaster.


When the fan broke it punctured a small hole in the coolant tank. The puncture was small enough that there was no noticeable leak at the track. It slowly emptied as we drove home, and within a few minutes, boom. To this day I am not sure how we did not notice the leak, or how my brother didn’t notice the temp gauge spike. In any event, what was done, was done. We had caused serious damage to the head gasket and scored multiple pistons. The only logical fix was a new motor.


**Part V: What’s Done Is Done**


Chalk it up to inexperience. Chalk it up to stupidity. The reality was that I was now out another $3,000. The car was worth its weight scrap with a blown motor, and a new motor was still cheaper than a Miata. With that in mind, we moved forward with the swap. Our mechanic found a low mileage S52, and over the course of a few weeks the new motor was dropped in, along with headers and full exhaust. If we were going to spend money the car, we were going to make sure the thing sounded damn good. We also added auxiliary water temp gauge, oil temp gauge, and most importantly a mechanical fan. No more overheating.


For some reason I thought this was going to be the end of our struggle fest. The day we got the car back, I drove down the street to get takeout. On the way back, the car suddenly died. I assumed dead battery, but the car was running and shutoff waiting at a light. My brother and I pushed the car about half a mile back to our house, and tried to jump the car. No dice. AAA was in front of the house the next morning. The fix was a simple fuse.


**Part V: Now What?**


At this point I knew without a doubt the car was cursed. I certainly did some dumb stuff along the way, but the eight or so track days we had attended had cost us something obscene, like $1,000 per session. It was outrageous. I still wanted to go to the track. I still wanted to drive in the canyons. I still wanted to own an E36 M3. I was just afraid of driving the damn thing. The car was my personal Eleanor.


Six months ago the car went into the garage. It gets pulled out for the occasional drive. But I am still petrified of track days. It makes no sense to sell the car, but at some point I need to simply cut my losses and accept the fact that I experienced a true money pit, and paid for great stories.


Would I recommend buying a track car as your commuter? Of course not. Would I do this all again? No question. My experiences with the M3 have been mostly terrible, but I’d never learn about what not to do, had I not done them. It’s like the silly cliché thing they tell you in 4th grade: you learn more from your mistakes than your successes.


On that note – anyone want to buy a highly modified 1999 BMW M3?
