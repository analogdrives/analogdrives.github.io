Not only have Subaru managed to produce better cars that get better gas mileage with better safety ratings; they have also gotten better at selling cars too. Incentives are amongst the lowest in the segment for key models and often sales are constrained by production. Day supply and fleet are both low. Odds are if you’re still reading this you’re an enthusiast and it fresh on your mind since you most likely helped your parents cross-shop a Forester with a CX-5 for them lately. Somewhere along your research you must have noticed what I noticed, Subaru is not what it used to be.

They have gone from a niche product lineup that was the cool Tacoma alternative in mountain towns across North America to being the premier outdoorsy yuppie-mobile on sale today. Nothing says I like to go be outdoorsy sometimes like a Subaru. Who cares if they only take it car camping once a year at a campground they made reservations at to pay $40 a night to sleep on a gravel square in a specific place in the woods with neighbors chanting “USA“ at midnight while they think about what wildlife might eat m; but they go camping dammint because they drive a Subaru!

Some where along the line Subaru lost its most lived-out-of car image in favor of gingham dress shirts and flexible work schedules. Even the WRX has officially stopped racing in the series it was named for then got neutered with a CVT.  Now that the WRX cares about fuel economy and to helping short attention-spanned tech-duches afraid to learn how to use an extra pedal get a sweet $299 lease deal on there dream car. Moral of the story Subaru has focused on everyone but there most loyal and enthusiast fan base; they have sold out.
