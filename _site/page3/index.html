        <p>Is car buying just too easy for you, too relaxing? Do you crave more excitement in your day-to-day? Want to raise the stakes and get that adrenaline coursing through your veins? Good news, I have just the thing for you: buy an exotic car like I did!</p>

<p>Where a normal person would think to themselves, “Hey, I need a used car, something flashy and fast, yeah. I’ll call a local dealership or go online to VehicleSwapper.com and find a suitable car within, say, 50 or so miles at a random used car lot that doesn’t look too sketchy. That’ll be fine!” And so off they go, not a care in the world. I, however, being a thoroughly <del>abnormal</del> person enthusiast immediately thought, “screw the used lot, they only sell the leftovers and trash from auctions. I need me a mint condition sports car with all the records and the eternal admiration of the previous owner, yeah that’s what I need. I should find something on the Porsche forums, that’s where they hide the good shit.”</p>

<p>So began my deep descent into insanity and the phoenix-like resurrection into <del>debt</del> car nirvana.</p>

<p>Shortly after moving to Los Angeles and weaseling my way into a crew of canyon carvers and car nuts, I had to take a step forward from the trusty Mazda3 daily driver to something that could hang with the thoroughbreds. There were some constraints: price had to be reasonable, preferably at the bottom of its depreciation curve, a coupe, manual gearbox, and most importantly, it had to be tall guy approved. Nobody wants to drive with a greasy hair stain in the headliner above the driver’s seat, that’s just in poor taste. My wife insisted on something of quality. Much to my dismay that disqualifies Corvette, Viper, and the pony cars. I see out of Miatas and S2000s by looking over the windshield frame, so that simply won’t do. BMW drivers are, well, BMW drivers. I don’t know if I was ready to eschew blinkers from my driving habits and blast DJ Tiesto from the stereo on repeat. That left Porsche. It was small, nimble, focused on the driving experience. Sublime steering, the slickest six speed I’ve ever driven, and an engine in the wrong place. It was simply divine intervention.</p>

<p>Off to the races, I was tapped into Bring a Trailer, Rennlist, Pelican Parts, the PCA Classifieds, really anywhere that decent used Porsches frequented. One, two, three weeks went by and there was no bait worth biting. The cars were either too old, too high mileage, or god forbid a cabrio. Have you seen a pretty 911 cabrio? No? Me neither. After about two months of hunting I came across a post that was a week old already, it was a 2006 911 997.1 (many numbers, bare with me) Carrera S. I had all the qualifications, six speed, low mileage, all the options, and a great price. By great price I mean grossly over budget, naturally. One caveat, the car was half way across the country in a barren wasteland called Houston, TX. No big deal, right?</p>

<p>I send an email just to dip my toes in the water and the third party responsible for the sale of the car responds quickly. We’ll call him “The Mechanic”. Not for anonymity or any nefarious reasons, he was literally a mechanic, and an Australian, but that’s irrelevant. We schedule a call and I’m on my A game; I’m asking all the right questions, he knows I mean business. Oil leaks, regular oil changes, how long has it sat, has the water pump been replaced, IMS bearing, I just went down the list. He knew I meant business (at least I think so, in reality he probably didn’t care much either way). Before parting ways I asked for the DME (Digital Motor Electronics) report to be sent over at his earliest convenience. In Porsche land this report shows a log from the onboard diagnostics of how many revolutions the engine spent at any of six ranges of RPMs. This is a general gauge of how healthy the engine is and how well the car was cared form an absolute necessity when buying a Porsche. The DME showed up in my inbox the next morning and it was perfect. Things are getting more serious now! My next contact is with the owner, who shall be called The Owner, for dramatic effect.</p>

<p>The story of the car goes as follows: The first owner bought the car, put next to no miles on it, traded it in and bought a Ferrari. I like to think that being a Texan, he struck oil, a la There Will be Blood, exclaimed, “Fuck it, time for a Ferrari” and drove straight to Neiman Marcus to buy (calf) leather gloves and a (Burberry)scarf. Have to look the business, you know? Regardless of <del>my speculation</del> the facts, the current owner got the car from a Porsche dealer as a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle with barely 25k miles in perfect condition. The Owner daily drove it 2 miles back and forth to work, tracked it a few times, and was absolutely in love with the car. The Owner is selling the car because she had to leave the country for work and was unable to import the car to Scotland. How hard could a vehicle transaction be even if they are out of the country? Is The Owner the most convincing Nigerian Scammer on Earth? I swear that thought went through my head. Never faltering, I looked potential disaster in the face and laughed. Some clever accounting with a sprinkle of numbers crunching and the car was just within budget. A pair of one-way tickets to Houston quickly followed.</p>

<p>Here’s a run-down of the plan: My wife and I are going to fly to Houston, get the car to a PPI, purchase it, stay the night with my brother, then embark on an epic road trip through west Texas (as fast as humanly possible), over to Santa Fe New Mexico, up to Flagstaff Arizona, and gracefully swooping back to home base in LA before both of us had to go back to work. Does this plan sound farfetched? I didn’t think so. Fun? Definitely.</p>

<p>Because I like to quote from books I haven’t read, “The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” Here’s what actually happened. We fly from LAX to Houston on time and without incident, take an Uber right to The Mechanic, luggage in tow. He shows us the car and it’s even better than the pictures! The car is absolutely immaculate. He drove it first because I wouldn’t do the irresponsible stuff on a test drive and rightfully scared the shit out of my wife and myself. I get the keys and head off to Swiss Garage (shout out, those guys are great!) to get my Pre Purchase Inspection done. Swiss garage is two miles away. I had two police cars tail me on the way there. Then two more on the way back just to keep me on edge. I’m pretty sure the Texas registration was expired too, lucky I didn’t get pulled over or I would have had to do some real smooth talking. You’ll never feel more conspicuous than when you’re driving a small sports car through a bad neighborhood in the truck infested streets of Texas. Yee-Haw!</p>

<p>I learn on my test drive that the car has a factory short-throw shifter kit that nobody cared to mention. Schwing! Long story short, the PPI went flawlessly save a rear headlight leveling sensor that was Macgyver-ed back into working order with some duct tape. The Mechanic was quite proud of that nugget of handy work upon mention of it, prevented(ing) the sensor from having to be replaced. Good enough for me. By now I’m all stages go, let’s do this thing. I ask to get in touch with The Owner to work out a (lower) number and finalize financing. This is where the plan goes a little off the rails. The Mechanic informs me that the only way he gets in touch with the owner is sending her a Facebook message and waiting for her to call on Skype. “Well that’s a little haphazard” I’m <del>pessimistically</del> optimistically thinking to myself. He assures me that this is the only way to get in contact with her. Maybe she is a Nigerian scammer, this is a pretty elaborate means of communication after all. The hours are ticking by on this Friday afternoon while I wait for a call from the bank and The Owner. Neither come. I was stuck in Texas with no money until Monday evening at the earliest, no communication with The Owner, and not enough time to make it back to LA if I wait it out. I believe they call this being between a rock and a hard place. We decide to cut our losses and hop the first flight out of there to try and salvage any part of our vacation time from work. The first flight out just happens to be straight to Las Vegas. Nice. Thanks to a combination of my wife’s mysterious gipsy powers and lack of patience we got out of Houston the day before flooding, that would have stranded us there for days, rolled through.</p>

<p>Fast forward a week and I finally get in contact with The Owner; She was vacationing in rural Australia with her family and was unable to find anywhere with WiFi to give me a call except the local McDonalds. That makes communication difficult to say the least. I say I want to buy the car then careen delicately into negotiations. I ask for money off, she is insistent on the asking price, hardball ensues and I put my foot down at $500 under asking price. Take it or leave it. How could $500 possible(ly) be worth risking the sale to her, who the hell else was going to jump through this many hoops to get this car at any price?! The conversation bitterly ends and she says she’ll get back to me. Radio silence for the next 24 hours. I get the email from The Owner saying they’re going to accept the offer! I thought it was all downhill from here, I was wrong.</p>

<p>Since my sweet road trip was now out of the question, I got a shipping truck lined up and asked that the title be sent separately from the car by way of UPS overnight. I get the cashier’s check for the car, handcuff it to my arm like an action movie, and head over to the local chase bank two blocks away. I deposit the check in The Owner’s account in a worryingly easy transaction with the teller. I’m not a religious man, but a little hail mary would have been the proper thing to do in the moment. Shortly thereafter the check clears, the car gets swooped up into the carrier,  and the pre-signed title is getting shipped out to me. I’m in the clear right? Thankfully, The Mechanic completely disregarded my repeated request to use UPS and sends it out certified mail through the ever reliable local USPS branch that has literally one star on Yelp. That’s who should be trusted with my damn title! I’m still <del>very</del> a little bitter about this.</p>

<p>One week goes by and the shipping information has not updated past the branch it was dropped off at, the person at the post office call center assures me that this is fairly normal. “Sometimes it just gets scanned as normal mail and not tracked mail, there’s nothing to be concerned about” she says. Fine. Patience is paramount. By this time the car had been delivered already and was sitting in the garage awaiting paperwork. Two weeks, then three crawl by and I start to panic. Endless calls to the USPS call centers, distribution centers, and branches come up fruitless. All the while my beast sits caged and undriven. Fate is a cruel mistress, maybe this is karmic retribution for past transgressions? Why me?</p>

<p>Ordering a replacement title is not as easy of a proposition as it sounds, I would have to send a request for a replacement title with payment from California to the Texas DMV, have them send the replacement to Scotland to get signed and such by The Owner, have her send it back to California so I can go to the DMV and register the car. By this time The Owner was becoming irritated and unresponsive making this simply not an option. There had to be a simpler way. Sure enough, I stumbled upon the thought of cars in estate sales and how there had to be a means of transferring rights of the cars after the owner was driving the streets of heaven. Eureka! There’s a power of attorney form that Texas has hidden in a sub page of a sub page of the DMV website. A clerk I talked with from the DMV confirmed that this rather unconventional means of title transferral could indeed be used in my situation. I signed and scanned the forms, emailed them to The Owner that same day asking her to sign two copies and mail them to me. A week or so later the letter was in my mailbox and no later was it forwarded with a replacement title request and a (yes this is true) $3 check for the Texas DMV. For those keeping tabs, this is now a month into dream car ownership with zero miles driven. Zero. Miles. Not one week later the golden ticket shows up in my mailbox and there was just two hurdles in my way now, the line at the DMV and the pain of giving them a couple grand in registration and sales tax. That one really hurt. Thankfully those two were quick and I finally had the joy of letting my prized stallion stretch it’s legs in the Malibu canyons. I had reached the holy land, hallowed ground.</p>

<p>To review for the sake of posterity, when purchasing a car make sure to meet the following criteria: set up a private sale with an unreachable international seller, whom requires voodoo magic to contact. Be confident with the robust and reliable process of purchasing a vehicle by buying one-way plane ticket to a place far far away, and always be sure to ship irreplaceable documents through USPS. That part’s really important. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, I suppose.</p>
